                                        We built this site to demonstrate that ranking systems can be built
                                        with the focus of educating graduate students and the public instead
                                        of opinionating them. The <a target="_blank" href="http://csrankings.org">CS Rankings</a>
                                        project is a good step in the direction of building fairer and more transparent systems for ranking.
                                        We have tried to build an extension of it that communicates a different view of the rankings.

                                    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">The By School and By Area tabs</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        We have identified that there are broadly two ways of looking at CS school rankings:
                                        a) looking at a particular school's overall research portfolio and b) looking
                                        at how different schools compete against each other in a particular area/combination of areas.
                                        This is the reason we have provided two views here.
                                        The <i>By School</i> view might be useful for graduate students to understand departments they would
                                        like to apply to or have offers from. The <i>By Area</i> view is the more conventional view of rankings.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Not all areas are the same</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Even when looking at rankings in a particular area, it is important to understand that not
                                        all rankings look the same. Very often, students have preconceived notions of prestige which might not
                                        hold true in all areas. To avoid this pitfall, we clearly show the Spearman's rank correlation with the "All Areas" rank
                                        of whatever areas are selected in the <i>By Area</i> view. Our main motive is to communicate that if an area has low
                                        correlation with the default ranking then students need to take a deeper look at the research and
                                        set aside their notions of institutional prestige.
                                        All rankings here are computed by aggregating research from year 2000 onwards.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistics over a distribution of rankings</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Moreover, we have observed that given the combinatorial flexibility of the CS Rankings system, there are 2<sup>areas</sup>
                                        ways to build a ranking and we have a distribution over ranks for each department. If somehow, certain attributes of
                                        this distribution could be communicated with the students, it might be beneficial to them. To this end, we compute
                                        stats like the mode, median, first and third quartile ranks out of each school's distributions. These stats are
                                        shown in the Ranking Statistics panel in the <i>By School</i> view. We compute these stats on a random sample of 200,000
                                        rankings out of the total 2<sup>areas</sup> rankings.
                                        We have also tried to highlight here any unconventional strenghts that a school might have; if an area's rank is 1.5 standard
                                        deviations above the computed median, it is mentioned as an unconventional strength for that school.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Faculty listing by area</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Eventually, we realize that rankings are only a small part of the complex problem of graduate school applications
                                        and that not all information can be computed. So we list faculty members that have published in the top venues in
                                        an area in the past 5 years and list down their homepages in the Faculty Listing section of the <i>By School</i>
                                        view. This is merely to enable the students to explore the faculty's research on their own, and make their own
                                        decisions thereon.
                                    </p>
